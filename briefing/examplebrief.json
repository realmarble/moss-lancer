    "ClientDescription":"ThirdComm is defined by its rejection of SecComm’s Anthrochauvinist values and its re-adoption of the Utopian Pillars. The old doctrine of aggressive colonial expansion and reconquest has been replaced with a hands-off approach to outreach, spearheaded by the Union Administrative Department (UAD). ThirdComm bore witness to SecComm’s crimes – ████████████████ █████████████████████████████████████████████ that brought about the change from the First Committee to the Second, countless colonial suppressions. Its response has been to pursue a slower, more moderated path toward galactic integration.",
    "MissionDescription":"ThirdComm, recoiling from the naked aggression of its predecessor, places much more emphasis on hegemony and as such, requests your assistance in securing the local planet colonies from the rapidly increasing number of attacks from a unidentified hostile party found present on the planet. Due to the Concern Of Life Treaty, any Union or Union-aligned Forces are required to contribute No Civilian Casualties to overall conflict death statistics. Pilots are allowed to act independently until either another Auxillary Union force arrives or is given other instructions by the Managing NHP known as REUSSITE. Terms of cooperation and payment can be found below.",
